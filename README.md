# DIY Intelligent Pulse Oximeter for Covid Patients
The Story:

Recently one of my friends got infected with Corona, The Doctors suggested him for Home Isolation and Prescribed some medication.
Also, they have suggested him to monitor Blood Oxygen levels, and call the Hospital staff if the blood oxygen levels are less than 95%. So that they can take him to the hospital and provide oxygen ventilation.

He is following our channel and liked the previous project called “IoT-based Covid Patient Blood Oxygen monitor” he asked me to develop the same thing, but he suggested some changes like This Oximeter should be worn like a traditional Oximeter and the SpO2 data should be shown on the OLED display.

I agreed with that because his suggestions make sense. previously I made the solution only on the breadboard, which is not portable and he cannot wear it. also, there are no Data readings on the screen. if he want to know the readings, he should open the Ubidots platform and see the data. which is a longer process. So, I thought the suggested changes would make this solution more convenient and robust. So agreed to make changes according to him. Recently, I have learned micro python, so I decided to make this using python only. so that I will get a chance to apply my theoretical learnings to practical applications.

Finally, the device is ready. we can call it as an Intelligent Pulse Oximeter for Covid Patients which is an updated version of the previous solution “IoT-based Covid Patient Blood Oxygen monitor”. This device will monitor patient’s blood oxygen levels and Heart rate then shows them on the OLED display, also it will post data to the Ubidots platform then trigger an alert to medical staff in case of emergency.

#Note: The Algorithm of SpO2 and Haertrate calculation needs an upgrade to measure the values more accurately.
